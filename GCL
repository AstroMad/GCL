/// @section Compilation Control
/// The following macros control how the code will be compiled for various applications.
/// @li @b GCL_NOBOOST - Do not use the Boost C++ libraries. This should only be used on platforms where the Boost C++ libraries are not 
///								      supported. By default the Boost C++ libraries are enabled.
/// @li @b GCL_NOMT - Do not use multi-threading. This should only be used on platforms where multi-threading is not available. By 
/// 									 default, multi-threading support is enabled.
/// @li @b GCL_REALTIME - Compile in the realtime library support. By default this will not be compiled in.
/// @li @b GCL_NOSTRINGS - Compile without using strings. This is intended to be used for embedded applications.
/// @li @b EMBEDDED - Compile the library for embedded applications.
/// @li @b GCL_CONTROL - Compile the library for control type applications.
